description:
  A DSEL for experimental game theory (a.k.a. evolutionary game theory,
  behavioral economics). Supports defining games and strategies, then executing
  them repeatedly in order to collect and observe the results.
  .
  Hagl provides built-in support for standard game representations, such as
  normal and extensive form, and constructs for defining games in terms of the
  manipulation of a shared state (as in tic-tac-toe). New game representations
  are supported via a type class.
  .
  A monadic strategy DSL supports concise and vaguely English-like definitions of
  strategies for playing games, usually iteratively.
  .
  While Hagl provides some basic game analyses, its primary focus is simulation
  and experimentation.  Games can be executed and strategies can be pitted
  against each other for repeated play and in various kinds of tournaments.
  .
  For some concrete examples, see the included README.md file, available online
